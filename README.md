# jqueryPlaylist

App Description
  This App use jQuery to make a request from http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/playlist.json and show a table with
  the first 10 songs, since that file does not allow cross origin, I decide to use a Node server to handle 
  the request using the Request Module.

Running the app
  1. Open your PC Shell && go into an empty folder
  2. Pull repository using the shell: git pull RepositoryURL
  3. Install Modules: npm install
  4. Run server.js file using Node: node server.js
  5. Open tableTemplate.html file
